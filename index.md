## What does Damascus stand for?
Damascus is named after "**Damascus blade**", which is a strong / sharp blade made out from Damascus steel and forged with a lost technology. Liferay has it's official development tool,"**Blade**", so I gave this name in hope of reinforcement or extension of Blade tool.
